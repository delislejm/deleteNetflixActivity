# Delete Netflix Activity script

This script removes easyly a user's "Activity" from a Netflix acount

## Getting Started

When you own a Netflix acount and want to delete your whole history not to be suggested movies by Netflix algorythm, you have to delete your video activity one by one and when it concerns a series, you have to come trough multiple deletion processes.

That's why i decided to automate this process.

## What does it do?

The scripts adds a button "Delete whole activity" in the "My activity" user page.

Clicking this button scans for links with a class of "deleteBtn", adds them in an array and clicks them automatically. It then performs a scan for links with a class of "removeSeries" and clicks them again. 

```
<a class="deleteBtn" href="#" data-reactid="id">Ã—</a>
<a class="removeSeries" data-reactid="id">Remove series?</a>
```

Once process is over you just have to press the "Done" button
